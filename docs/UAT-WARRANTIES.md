## How to run UAT

1. Sign in as **Abbas Bhai** (`abbas@carcapital.uk` / `CarCap!demo1`). He's the super-user so every capability gate passes by default. For permission-gating cases (UAT-W-23) you'll switch to a non-admin user.
2. Ensure the demo seed has the **delta** rows applied — there should be **9 in-house** warranties, **5 external** (3 pending, 2 purchased), and **4 claims**.
3. For each numbered case below: follow the steps, compare to the expected result, tick **Pass** or **Fail**. Add a note for anything fishy even if you ticked Pass.
4. If a case fails, file a ticket referencing the case ID (`UAT-W-NN`) so the engineer can reproduce.

## GEN-66 — a warranty is created when a sales invoice is closed

Closing a sales invoice declares the buyer's cover in Section F, but until
GEN-66 nothing wrote a `warranties` row — selecting "in-house" produced a PDF
and nothing else, so the In-House tab was only ever populated by hand.

Scope: `/sales/invoice-generation` Section F, `warrantyService.syncFromInvoice`,
migration `0036_warranty_invoice_link.sql`.

| # | Test case | Steps | Expected result | Status |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 26 | In-house creates a record | Generate a sales invoice with **Warranty provided by = Car Capital (in-house)** | A warranty appears under **Warranties → In-House** for that vehicle and customer. | ☐ |
| 27 | Record contents | Open it | Type in-house, provider "Car Capital", cover summary matching Section F, start = invoice date, end = start + the declared duration. | ☐ |
| 28 | Linked to the invoice | On the detail sheet | "Issued by invoice INV-…" links back to it. | ☐ |
| 29 | External still works | Generate an invoice with **External provider** + a provider name | A record appears under **External**, purchase status **Pending**, so Mark Purchased still applies. | ☐ |
| 30 | Provider required | Choose External and leave the provider name blank | Blocked: "Provider name is required for an external warranty". | ☐ |
| 31 | No over-trigger | Generate an invoice with **Non-Warranty Disclaimer** ticked | No warranty record is created. Section F says so before you submit. | ☐ |
| 32 | No duplicates on re-save | Edit and re-save the same invoice | The existing warranty is updated. There is still exactly one. | ☐ |
| 33 | Retracted on edit | Edit an invoice that issued cover, tick the disclaimer, save | Its warranty is **cancelled**, not left live behind an invoice that no longer offers it. | ☐ |
| 34 | Type switch | Edit an in-house invoice to external and save | The record moves to the External tab and its purchase status becomes Pending. An already-purchased policy keeps "purchased". | ☐ |
| 35 | Price carried over | Invoice with a paid Warranty add-on line | Cost to customer equals the add-on total. A free warranty add-on records £0. | ☐ |
| 36 | Month clamping | Invoice dated 31 Jan with 3-month cover | Ends **30 Apr**, not 1 May. | ☐ |
