/**
 * Fire-and-forget pre-fetch of the queries every dashboard route reads.
 *
 * Called once from the auth context as soon as `user` + `company` resolve.
 * All these methods go through `src/lib/cache.ts` (`withCache`), so by the
 * time any dashboard component's useEffect runs `vehicleService.getAll(…)`
 * the in-flight promise is already settled (or the cached value is ready)
 * and `setState` happens synchronously enough to feel instant.
 *
 * Failures here are silently swallowed — each component still does its own
 * fetch on mount; the warm-up is a best-effort optimisation, not a hard
 * dependency. The 30s TTL on the cache means even slow networks benefit
 * because subsequent navigations reuse the populated entries.
