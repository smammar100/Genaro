 * WHY IT FOLLOWS A CAR, NOT THE FEATURE LIST
 * The nav is ordered by a vehicle's life through the business (see
 * SIDEBAR_GROUPS), and the tour walks that same path in the same order:
 * arrive, inspect, prep, sell, aftercare, review. Teaching the order someone
 * actually works in is what turns into muscle memory — a tour of every screen
 * in menu order teaches a menu, which nobody remembers.
 *
 * WHY THE USER CLICKS INSTEAD OF PRESSING NEXT
 * Every middle step highlights a nav item and waits for the user to click it.
 * They arrive at each page by the route they will use every day afterwards,
 * with their own hand, rather than watching the app navigate itself.
 *
 * Steps deliberately do NOT depend on any record existing. The database ships
 * empty, and a tour that says "open your first vehicle" breaks on day one.
