/**
 * Postcode → address suggestions.
 *
 * The UI is a list you pick from. What can populate that list depends entirely
 * on the provider:
 *
 * - **postcodes.io** (current, free) is a GEOGRAPHIC service. It resolves a
 *   postcode to its ward, district and region and holds no street names,
 *   house numbers or flats. It can therefore only ever return ONE suggestion —
 *   the locality — with the house number left for the user.
 * - **A PAF provider** (getAddress.io, Ideal Postcodes, Loqate) returns every
 *   delivery point for the postcode, which is the multi-address list people
 *   expect from a shop checkout.
 *
 * Verified 2026-07-21 that no free source closes this gap: postcodes.io
 * returns 46 fields, none address-related; Nominatim returns the postcode
 * centroid only; OSM/Overpass has no address nodes for the test postcodes.
 *
 * Swapping provider means implementing `AddressProvider` and changing
 * `activeProvider` — nothing above this file changes.
