/**
 * Page-level content wrapper. Every dashboard route's main content sits
 * inside one of these — the dashboard layout wraps `{children}` in
 * `<PageShell>` by default. Content fills the full available width
 * (minus the symmetric p-6 / md:p-8 padding) up to a 1400px outer cap.
 *
 * **Default cap = 1400px.** A narrower 1152 cap left a visibly empty
 * band on each side of the dashboard on the dealer's typical 1366px /
 * 1920px monitors. Switching to 1400 makes content go effectively edge-to-
 * edge on a 1366 viewport (1366 − 260 sidebar − 64 padding ≈ 1042px
 * of content area, well below the cap) while still centring on
 * extra-wide monitors so paragraph line-lengths don't get absurd.
 *
 * **Opt-in `wide` = 1400px (same as default for now).** The prop is
 * kept so pages can declare intent ("this page needs the full width")
 * even though the visual is identical today. If we later want a
 * narrower default for forms, the wide variant stays as an escape
 * hatch and existing consumers don't change.
