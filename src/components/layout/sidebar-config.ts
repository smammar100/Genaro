 *   Maintenance — it is inspected, then prepped and repaired
 *   Advert      — it goes to market (hidden for the MVP launch)
 *   Sales       — it is sold
 *   Warranties  — cover on cars sold, and the occasional return
 *   Admin       — oversight of all of the above
 *
 * Within a group the same rule applies: the steps come first, in the order
 * they happen, and anything that merely looks at those steps — an overview,
 * a calendar — comes after them. Maintenance is the case that matters, where
 * only the first two entries are stages a car passes through.
 *
 * Administrative used to sit second, directly under Dashboard, which pushed
 * every stage of the actual workflow below a group nobody touches hourly.
 * It now sits last: it reports on the lifecycle rather than being part of it.
 *
 * Items inside each group follow the same rule — Maintenance opens with the
 * Inspection Queue because that is what a car hits first, not the Pipeline
 * overview.
 *
 * `requiredAnyOf` gates visibility by capability (see nav.ts). Each
 * item's capabilities mirror the guard on its page so the nav and the page
 * agree on who may enter.
